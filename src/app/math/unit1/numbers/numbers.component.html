<h1>Natural Numbers And Whole Numbers</h1>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p> <b>Natural Numbers :</b></p>
        <p>Natural numbers are denoted by 'N'.numbers starting from '1 ' (one).
            N = {{ "{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, .........}" }}</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p> <b>Whole Numbers :</b></p>
        <p>Whole numbers are denoted by 'W'.numbers starting from '0' (zero).
            W = {{ "{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, .........}" }}</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p> <b>Even Numbers :</b></p>
        <p> Numbers which are the multiples of '2' are called 'Even Numbers '.
            E = {{ "{2, 4, 6, 8, .........}" }}</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p> <b>Odd Numbers :</b></p>
        <p> Numbers which are not the multiples of '2' are called 'Odd Numbers'.
            Odd = {{ "{1, 3, 5, 7, .........}" }}</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p> The smallest Natural Number is '1 ' and the smallest
            Whole Number is '0'.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p> There do not exist the largest Natural number and
            the largest Whole number.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The successor of any whole number is one more than that whole number.</p>
        <p> Ex : Successor of 11 is 12, (11 + 1)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The predecessor of any whole number is one less
            than that whole number.</p>
        <p> Ex : Predecessor of 11 is 10 (11 1)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>There is no predecessor of zero in whole numbers.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Face value and place value :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Face value of a digit is the digit itsell
                Ex.: Face value of '5' in 325 is '5'</li>

            <li>Place value of a digit is the value of the digit in its place.
                Ex. : Place value of '5' in 352 is 50 [5 x 10]</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p> <b>Consecutive Numbers :</b></p>
        <p>The Numbers which differ from each other by one are called 'Consecutive Numbers'.
            Ex. : 13, 14 and 19, 20 are Consecutive Numbers</p>
    </li>
